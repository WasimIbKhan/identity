HI EXAMINER HOPE YOUR DAYS GONE WELL

I'll brief you on how to install this project 

Run the file in your terminal, run these commands 

npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

npm install

amplify configure

Then it should ask you your aws region, gor for eu-west-2 since we live in London
Then it asks you for a aws keys
Access key ID: AKIAZX52G3MK7KNDS45A
Secret access key: OYe9BBWqVfsYkxZb52F8pInS3A6yDnQfrtHS7OtU

name your profile whatever you want 

amplify init

Name your environment whatever you want

amplify pull

npm start

And you should be set

if you have aws ampkify problems just type in the terminal 

npm start
